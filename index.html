        This is the project to learn building modal window, which is widely used
        component of any web application now a days. There is so much to learn
        while building this amazing project. For me it was an amazing experience
        to learn about CSS and how the cascade works in this style sheet. If we
        are not careful about the cascade and how CSS gives priority to
        different selectors then we would waste so much time wondering why
        things are not working how they are supposed to be working.
